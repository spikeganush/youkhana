## Project Goal

Transform the Youkhana website from a Shopify-based e-commerce platform to a **rental product management system** where admins can add, manage, and display products available for rent (not purchase).

**Status**: üü° In Progress (Phase 10 Completed - Public Rental Catalog)
**Started**: 2025-10-26
**Target Completion**: TBD

---

## Business Context

### Current Situation

- Website originally designed for e-commerce with Shopify integration
- Shopify code remains in codebase but is deprecated (keeping for future reference)
- Owner wants to shift business model from **selling** to **renting** products

### New Business Model

- **Primary Purpose**: Rental product catalog and management
- **Admin Goal**: Easy product management (add/edit/delete rental items)
- **User Goal**: Browse rental catalog, view pricing, request rentals
- **No e-commerce transactions** (for now - booking/payment system is future phase)

### Key Difference from Shopify

- Products show **rental pricing** (daily/weekly/monthly) instead of purchase price
- Availability tracking (units available vs total units)
- Security deposit concept
- Rental terms and conditions per product

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Product Storage: Redis

**Reason**: Consistent with existing stack, fast, serverless-friendly

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ‚ùå PostgreSQL: Requires separate database, more infrastructure
- ‚ùå MongoDB: Extra service, monthly cost
- ‚ùå Keep Shopify: Business model has changed, no longer selling products
- ‚úÖ Redis: Already in use, fast, sufficient for product catalog

### Image Storage: Vercel Blob

**Reason**: Native Vercel integration, 1 GB is sufficient for rental product catalog, zero configuration

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è UploadThing: 2-10 GB free but adds external dependency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloudinary: Good free tier (25 credits/month) but expensive paid plans ($89+/month)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AWS S3: Complex setup, requires credit card, not beginner-friendly
- ‚úÖ Vercel Blob: 1 GB free, native Vercel integration, built into Next.js ecosystem

**Vercel Blob Free Tier (Hobby Plan)**:

- Storage: 1 GB/month
- Bandwidth: 10 GB/month
- Simple Operations: First 10,000 free
- Features: Zero-config, CDN delivery, automatic optimization, native Next.js integration
- Perfect for rental product catalog (1 GB = ~200-500 high-quality product images)

**Why 1 GB is Enough**:

- Rental business typically has 50-200 products max
- With Next.js Image optimization, images are compressed efficiently
- Multiple images per product: 3-5 images √ó 100 products = 300-500 images
- Average optimized image size: 200-500 KB
- Total estimated usage: 60-250 MB (well under 1 GB limit)

### UI Components: Reuse Shopify Design

**Reason**: Product cards, grid layout, and detail pages already designed and responsive

**Strategy**:

- Keep existing components: `Products-Card.tsx`, product grid layouts
- Modify to show rental pricing instead of purchase price
- Add rental-specific fields (daily/weekly/monthly rates, deposit, availability)
- Reuse responsive grid (1 col mobile ‚Üí 2 cols sm ‚Üí 4 cols lg)

  - [x] Keyboard navigation in command menu

#### Files Created

- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/novel-editor.tsx` - Rich text editor component
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/novel-viewer.tsx` - Read-only content viewer
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/novel-extensions.ts` - Tiptap extensions configuration
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/slash-command.tsx` - Slash command definitions
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/text-buttons.tsx` - Formatting button toolbar
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/image-upload.ts` - Image upload utilities (stub)

#### Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/product-form.tsx` - Replaced textarea with NovelEditor
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/product-preview-dialog.tsx` - Added NovelViewer for descriptions
- ‚úÖ `/tailwind.config.ts` - Added typography plugin

#### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "novel": "^1.0.2"
}
```

**Note**: `@tailwindcss/typography` was already installed but needed to be enabled in config.

#### Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ WYSIWYG editing with Notion-style interface
- ‚úÖ Slash commands for quick formatting (headings, lists, quotes, code blocks)
- ‚úÖ Text selection bubble menu with formatting buttons
- ‚úÖ Support for: Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Code

- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation in command menu (arrow keys, enter)

#### Technical Decisions

**Content Storage**:
- Store content as stringified JSON in the `description` field
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing plain text
- Viewer handles both JSON and plain text gracefully

**Extensions Used**:
- StarterKit (basic editing functionality)
- Placeholder extension
- TiptapLink (hyperlinks)
- TiptapImage (image support)
- TiptapUnderline
- TaskList/TaskItem (checkable tasks)
- HorizontalRule
- Slash command for quick formatting

**Styling Approach**:
- Use Tailwind's `prose` classes for typography
- Dark mode support with `dark:prose-invert`
- Custom styles for editor interface elements

#### Known Issues & Future Improvements

- Image upload in editor uses placeholder (ObjectURL) - needs integration with Vercel Blob (Phase 8)
- Could add more slash commands (tables, embeds, etc.)
- Could add color picker for text highlighting
- Could add link editing bubble menu

---

#### Notes

**Implementation Completed**: 2025-10-26

**Key Decisions**:

- Used native HTML5 drag & drop instead of react-dropzone to reduce dependencies
- Image reordering with left/right arrow buttons instead of dnd-kit (simpler UX)
- Upload happens via `/api/upload` route with RBAC permission checks
- Images stored in `products/` folder with timestamp prefix for uniqueness
- Max 10 images per product, 4.5 MB per image
- Automatic cleanup when products are deleted or images removed
- Alt text editing for accessibility

**Files Created**:

1. `/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Authenticated upload endpoint with permission checks
2. `/lib/blob-helpers.ts` - Complete image upload/delete utilities
3. `/components/admin/image-uploader.tsx` - Multi-image uploader with drag & drop
4. `/components/admin/image-preview.tsx` - Image preview with reorder, alt text, delete

**Files Modified**:

1. `/components/admin/product-form.tsx` - Integrated ImageUploader component
2. `/lib/rental-products.ts` - Added image deletion in `deleteProduct()` and `updateProduct()`
3. `/next.config.js` - Added `**.public.blob.vercel-storage.com` to image remotePatterns

**Features Implemented**:

- ‚úÖ Multi-image upload with drag & drop
- ‚úÖ Image preview grid (2-4 columns responsive)
- ‚úÖ Image reordering with arrow buttons
- ‚úÖ Alt text editing for accessibility
- ‚úÖ Primary image badge (first image)
- ‚úÖ Delete individual images
- ‚úÖ Upload progress indicator
- ‚úÖ File validation (type & size)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic Vercel Blob cleanup on delete

**Technical Details**:

- Images use `RentalProductImage` type from rental-product.ts
- Upload API checks for authentication and MANAGE_PRODUCTS permission
- Images stored with structure: `{ url, pathname, alt, order }`
- First image (order: 0) is the primary product image
- Blob deletion is non-blocking (won't fail operations if blob delete fails)

**Challenges Resolved**:

- Fixed TypeScript type errors (ProductImage ‚Üí RentalProductImage)
- Fixed Next.js image configuration for Vercel Blob hostname
- Fixed authentication imports (getServerSession ‚Üí getSession)
- Handled RBAC permission checks correctly (role-based, not email-based)

**Testing Notes**:

- Type check passes: `npx tsc --noEmit` ‚úÖ
- Next.js config updated and requires dev server restart
- Upload functionality tested and working
- Image display requires adding Blob hostname to next.config.js (completed)

#### Files Created

- ‚úÖ `/types/rental-inquiry.ts` - Type definitions and Redis key patterns
- ‚úÖ `/lib/rental-inquiries.ts` - Complete CRUD operations library
- ‚úÖ `/app/api/rental-inquiry/route.ts` - Public API endpoint for submissions
- ‚úÖ `/app/admin/rental-inquiries/page.tsx` - Admin inquiry management page
- ‚úÖ `/app/admin/rental-inquiries/actions.ts` - Server actions with RBAC
- ‚úÖ `/components/Shop/product/Rental-inquiry-dialog.tsx` - Customer inquiry form
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/inquiry-table.tsx` - Admin table with filtering

#### Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/lib/audit-log.ts` - Added generic `logAction()` function
- ‚úÖ `/actions/sendEmail.ts` - Added `sendRentalInquiryEmail()` function
- ‚úÖ `/app/admin/page.tsx` - Added inquiry stats to dashboard
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/sidebar.tsx` - Added rental inquiries navigation link
- ‚úÖ `/app/product/[handle]/page.tsx` - Integrated inquiry dialog
- ‚úÖ `/components/Shop/product/Purchase-button.tsx` - Changed to rental inquiry button

#### Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Customer inquiry submission form on product pages
- ‚úÖ Rental date selection with validation
- ‚úÖ Product variant selection (size, color, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Automatic pricing calculation based on rental period
- ‚úÖ Email notifications to owner with inquiry details
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard for managing inquiries
- ‚úÖ Status tracking (pending ‚Üí contacted ‚Üí confirmed ‚Üí completed)
- ‚úÖ Admin notes on inquiries
- ‚úÖ Filtering by status, product, customer
- ‚úÖ Inquiry statistics on admin dashboard
- ‚úÖ RBAC integration (MANAGE_PRODUCTS permission required)
- ‚úÖ Audit logging for all inquiry actions
- ‚úÖ Redis storage with sorted sets for efficient querying

#### Technical Decisions

**Storage Strategy**:
- Store inquiries in Redis with unique UUID keys
- Use sorted sets for chronological ordering (score = timestamp)
- Index by status, product, and customer for efficient filtering
- Store pricing snapshot at time of inquiry for reference

**Email Configuration**:
- Send to testing email during development (`florian.jourdain@gmail.com`)
- Use `rentals@callmespike.me` as sender
- Reply-to set to customer email for easy communication
- Professional HTML email template with gradient header

**Form Design**:
- Integrated directly into product page (dialog)
- Auto-populate product information
- Calculate estimated total based on rental period
- Validate dates (start date must be before end date)
- Support for optional phone number and message

**Admin Interface**:
- Reuse existing admin table patterns (TanStack Table)
- Status badges with color coding
- Quick actions for status updates
- Separate notes field for internal tracking
- Soft delete (remove from Redis)

#### Type Error Fixes

Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:
1. `logAction` not exported from `lib/audit-log.ts` - Added generic audit logging function
2. `currentUser.email` can be `null` - Added fallback to `'unknown'` in all action functions
3. `respondedBy` field type mismatch - Convert `null` to `undefined` for optional string fields

All type checks now pass: `npm run type-check` ‚úÖ

#### Notes

**Implementation Completed**: 2025-10-26

This phase implements the foundation for the booking/reservation system mentioned in Phase 10, but with a simpler inquiry-based approach:
- Customers submit rental requests (not bookings)
- Owner receives email notifications
- Admin manually manages inquiries and confirms availability
- No automated calendar or payment processing yet

**Future Enhancements** (Phase 10):
- Automated availability checking
- Calendar view for rental periods
- Payment processing integration
- Customer booking dashboard
- Automated confirmation emails

### Phase 10: Public Rental Catalog ‚è≥ (2-3 hours)

**Status**: üü¢ Completed
**Started**: 2025-10-26
**Completed**: 2025-10-26

#### Overview

Created a public-facing rental catalog where users can browse all available rental products, filter by category, search by tags, and view detailed product information.

#### Tasks Completed

- [x] Create rental catalog page (`/app/rent/page.tsx`)
- [x] Build product grid component (responsive 1/2/4 columns)
- [x] Create rental product cards (adapted from Shopify design patterns)
- [x] Implement search functionality (tag-based search)
- [x] Implement category filtering
- [x] Add sorting by date and price
- [x] Update navigation (add "Rent" link, mark "Shop" as deprecated)
- [x] Mark Shopify code as deprecated

#### Files Created

- ‚úÖ `/app/rent/page.tsx` - Public rental catalog page
- ‚úÖ `/components/Shop/Rental-Products-Card.tsx` - Rental product card component with grid layout
- ‚úÖ `/components/Shop/Rental-Search-Bar.tsx` - Search and filter component for rental products

#### Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/components/Header/Header.tsx` - Added "Rent" link to navigation, marked "Shop" as deprecated
- ‚úÖ `/app/shop/page.tsx` - Added deprecation notice
- ‚úÖ `/components/Shop/Products-Card.tsx` - Added deprecation notice
- ‚úÖ `/components/Shop/Search-Bar.tsx` - Added deprecation notice
- ‚úÖ `/lib/shopify/index.ts` - Added deprecation notice

#### Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ Public rental catalog displaying all active products
- ‚úÖ Responsive product grid (1 column mobile ‚Üí 2 columns sm ‚Üí 4 columns lg)
- ‚úÖ Product cards showing:
  - Primary product image
  - Title and short description
  - Daily, weekly rental rates
  - Category badge
  - Featured badge
  - Availability status
- ‚úÖ Tag-based search with autocomplete suggestions
- ‚úÖ Category dropdown filter
- ‚úÖ Sort by date or price (ascending/descending)
- ‚úÖ Filter reset functionality
- ‚úÖ Empty state message when no products match filters
- ‚úÖ Links to individual product detail pages
- ‚úÖ Navigation updated with "Rent" link

#### Technical Decisions

**Component Reuse**:
- Adapted Shopify components (Products-Card.tsx, Search-Bar.tsx) for rental products
- Maintained same responsive grid layout (1/2/4 columns)
- Added category filter dropdown (new feature)
- Kept tag-based search with autocomplete
- Added availability badges for out-of-stock items

**Data Fetching**:
- Fetch only active products using `getAllProducts({ status: 'active' })`
- Client-side filtering for tags, categories, and sorting
- All filtering happens in browser for instant results

**Design Choices**:
- Show daily rate prominently with weekly rate below
- Display category as outlined badge
- Featured products get yellow badge
- Unavailable items show red "Unavailable" badge
- Empty state with helpful message

**Code Organization**:
- Kept components in `/components/Shop/` directory
- Used "Rental" prefix for new components (Rental-Products-Card.tsx, Rental-Search-Bar.tsx)
- Marked old Shopify components as deprecated but kept them for reference
- Added clear deprecation notices pointing to new rental system

#### Notes

**Implementation Completed**: 2025-10-26

This phase successfully replaces the Shopify shop page with a rental catalog. The new `/rent` page uses the rental product system built in Phases 7-9, providing a complete public-facing catalog for browsing rental items.

**Key Differences from Shopify Shop**:
- Shows rental pricing (daily/weekly) instead of purchase price
- Category filter dropdown for easier browsing
- Availability badges show stock status
- Featured product badges highlight important items
- Tag-based search for flexible product discovery

**Next Steps**:
- Future enhancement: Add featured products section to homepage
- Future enhancement: Add product comparison feature
- Future enhancement: Add "Recently Viewed" products tracking

### Phase 11: Advanced Booking Features ‚è≥ (Future)

**Status**: üî¥ Not Started - Future Enhancement
**Started**: _Not yet_
**Completed**: _Not yet_

#### Overview

Enhance the rental inquiry system with automated features:

- Calendar availability view
- Real-time inventory checking
- Automated booking confirmations
- Payment processing integration (Stripe)

#### Files to Mark as Deprecated

Add comment at top of Shopify-related files:

```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated This file uses Shopify integration which is no longer active.
 * Kept for reference only. See /app/rent/* for rental product implementation.
 */
```

#### Files to Mark

- [ ] `/lib/shopify/*.ts`
- [ ] `/app/shop/page.tsx`
- [ ] `/components/Shop/*` (except reusable patterns)

#### Navigation Updates
