## Project Goal

Transform the Youkhana website from a Shopify-based e-commerce platform to a **rental product management system** where admins can add, manage, and display products available for rent (not purchase).

**Status**: üü° In Progress (Phase 8 Completed - Image Upload)
**Started**: 2025-10-26
**Target Completion**: TBD

---

## Business Context

### Current Situation

- Website originally designed for e-commerce with Shopify integration
- Shopify code remains in codebase but is deprecated (keeping for future reference)
- Owner wants to shift business model from **selling** to **renting** products

### New Business Model

- **Primary Purpose**: Rental product catalog and management
- **Admin Goal**: Easy product management (add/edit/delete rental items)
- **User Goal**: Browse rental catalog, view pricing, request rentals
- **No e-commerce transactions** (for now - booking/payment system is future phase)

### Key Difference from Shopify

- Products show **rental pricing** (daily/weekly/monthly) instead of purchase price
- Availability tracking (units available vs total units)
- Security deposit concept
- Rental terms and conditions per product

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Product Storage: Redis

**Reason**: Consistent with existing stack, fast, serverless-friendly

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ‚ùå PostgreSQL: Requires separate database, more infrastructure
- ‚ùå MongoDB: Extra service, monthly cost
- ‚ùå Keep Shopify: Business model has changed, no longer selling products
- ‚úÖ Redis: Already in use, fast, sufficient for product catalog

### Image Storage: Vercel Blob

**Reason**: Native Vercel integration, 1 GB is sufficient for rental product catalog, zero configuration

**Alternatives Considered**:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è UploadThing: 2-10 GB free but adds external dependency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cloudinary: Good free tier (25 credits/month) but expensive paid plans ($89+/month)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è AWS S3: Complex setup, requires credit card, not beginner-friendly
- ‚úÖ Vercel Blob: 1 GB free, native Vercel integration, built into Next.js ecosystem

**Vercel Blob Free Tier (Hobby Plan)**:

- Storage: 1 GB/month
- Bandwidth: 10 GB/month
- Simple Operations: First 10,000 free
- Features: Zero-config, CDN delivery, automatic optimization, native Next.js integration
- Perfect for rental product catalog (1 GB = ~200-500 high-quality product images)

**Why 1 GB is Enough**:

- Rental business typically has 50-200 products max
- With Next.js Image optimization, images are compressed efficiently
- Multiple images per product: 3-5 images √ó 100 products = 300-500 images
- Average optimized image size: 200-500 KB
- Total estimated usage: 60-250 MB (well under 1 GB limit)

### UI Components: Reuse Shopify Design

**Reason**: Product cards, grid layout, and detail pages already designed and responsive

**Strategy**:

- Keep existing components: `Products-Card.tsx`, product grid layouts
- Modify to show rental pricing instead of purchase price
- Add rental-specific fields (daily/weekly/monthly rates, deposit, availability)
- Reuse responsive grid (1 col mobile ‚Üí 2 cols sm ‚Üí 4 cols lg)

### Phase 7.5: Rich Text Editor Integration (Novel) ‚úÖ (~1 hour)

**Status**: üü¢ Completed
**Started**: 2025-10-26
**Completed**: 2025-10-26

#### Overview

Enhanced the product description field with a Notion-style WYSIWYG editor using the Novel package, replacing the basic textarea with a rich text editor that supports formatting, headings, lists, and more.

#### Tasks Completed

- [x] Install Novel editor
  - [x] `npm install novel` (added 182 packages)
- [x] Create Novel editor components
  - [x] `/components/admin/novel-editor.tsx` - Editable rich text editor

  - [x] Keyboard navigation in command menu

#### Files Created

- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/novel-editor.tsx` - Rich text editor component
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/novel-viewer.tsx` - Read-only content viewer
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/novel-extensions.ts` - Tiptap extensions configuration
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/slash-command.tsx` - Slash command definitions
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/text-buttons.tsx` - Formatting button toolbar
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/image-upload.ts` - Image upload utilities (stub)

#### Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/product-form.tsx` - Replaced textarea with NovelEditor
- ‚úÖ `/components/admin/product-preview-dialog.tsx` - Added NovelViewer for descriptions
- ‚úÖ `/tailwind.config.ts` - Added typography plugin

#### Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "novel": "^1.0.2"
}
```

**Note**: `@tailwindcss/typography` was already installed but needed to be enabled in config.

#### Features Implemented

- ‚úÖ WYSIWYG editing with Notion-style interface
- ‚úÖ Slash commands for quick formatting (headings, lists, quotes, code blocks)
- ‚úÖ Text selection bubble menu with formatting buttons
- ‚úÖ Support for: Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Code
- ‚úÖ Support for: Headings (H1-H3), Bullet Lists, Numbered Lists, Blockquotes, Code Blocks
- ‚úÖ Support for: Task lists, Horizontal rules, Links, Images
- ‚úÖ Proper prose styling for read-only content display
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility with plain text descriptions
- ‚úÖ Keyboard navigation in command menu (arrow keys, enter)

#### Technical Decisions

**Content Storage**:
- Store content as stringified JSON in the `description` field
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing plain text
- Viewer handles both JSON and plain text gracefully

**Extensions Used**:
- StarterKit (basic editing functionality)
- Placeholder extension
- TiptapLink (hyperlinks)
- TiptapImage (image support)
- TiptapUnderline
- TaskList/TaskItem (checkable tasks)
- HorizontalRule
- Slash command for quick formatting

**Styling Approach**:
- Use Tailwind's `prose` classes for typography
- Dark mode support with `dark:prose-invert`
- Custom styles for editor interface elements

#### Known Issues & Future Improvements

- Image upload in editor uses placeholder (ObjectURL) - needs integration with Vercel Blob (Phase 8)
- Could add more slash commands (tables, embeds, etc.)
- Could add color picker for text highlighting
- Could add link editing bubble menu

---

### Phase 8: Image Upload System ‚è≥ (2-3 hours)

2. Go to Storage tab
3. Create a new Blob store (or use existing)
4. Copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
5. Add to `.env.local` for development
6. Vercel automatically provides it in production

#### Notes

**Implementation Completed**: 2025-10-26

**Key Decisions**:

- Used native HTML5 drag & drop instead of react-dropzone to reduce dependencies
- Image reordering with left/right arrow buttons instead of dnd-kit (simpler UX)
- Upload happens via `/api/upload` route with RBAC permission checks
- Images stored in `products/` folder with timestamp prefix for uniqueness
- Max 10 images per product, 4.5 MB per image
- Automatic cleanup when products are deleted or images removed
- Alt text editing for accessibility

**Files Created**:

1. `/app/api/upload/route.ts` - Authenticated upload endpoint with permission checks
2. `/lib/blob-helpers.ts` - Complete image upload/delete utilities
3. `/components/admin/image-uploader.tsx` - Multi-image uploader with drag & drop
4. `/components/admin/image-preview.tsx` - Image preview with reorder, alt text, delete

**Files Modified**:

1. `/components/admin/product-form.tsx` - Integrated ImageUploader component
2. `/lib/rental-products.ts` - Added image deletion in `deleteProduct()` and `updateProduct()`
3. `/next.config.js` - Added `**.public.blob.vercel-storage.com` to image remotePatterns

**Features Implemented**:

- ‚úÖ Multi-image upload with drag & drop
- ‚úÖ Image preview grid (2-4 columns responsive)
- ‚úÖ Image reordering with arrow buttons
- ‚úÖ Alt text editing for accessibility
- ‚úÖ Primary image badge (first image)
- ‚úÖ Delete individual images
- ‚úÖ Upload progress indicator
- ‚úÖ File validation (type & size)
- ‚úÖ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ‚úÖ Automatic Vercel Blob cleanup on delete

**Technical Details**:

- Images use `RentalProductImage` type from rental-product.ts
- Upload API checks for authentication and MANAGE_PRODUCTS permission
- Images stored with structure: `{ url, pathname, alt, order }`
- First image (order: 0) is the primary product image
- Blob deletion is non-blocking (won't fail operations if blob delete fails)

**Challenges Resolved**:

- Fixed TypeScript type errors (ProductImage ‚Üí RentalProductImage)
- Fixed Next.js image configuration for Vercel Blob hostname
- Fixed authentication imports (getServerSession ‚Üí getSession)
- Handled RBAC permission checks correctly (role-based, not email-based)

**Testing Notes**:

- Type check passes: `npx tsc --noEmit` ‚úÖ
- Next.js config updated and requires dev server restart
- Upload functionality tested and working
- Image display requires adding Blob hostname to next.config.js (completed)

### Phase 10: Booking/Reservation System ‚è≥ (Future)

**Status**: üî¥ Not Started - Future Enhancement
**Started**: _Not yet_
**Completed**: _Not yet_

#### Overview

This is a **future phase** - not part of immediate implementation. This would add:

- Rental request/booking functionality
- Calendar availability view
- Admin approval workflow
- Automatic inventory management
- Email notifications for rental requests
- Potential payment integration (Stripe)

#### High-Level Tasks (Deferred)

- [ ] Design reservation data model
- [ ] Create booking request form
- [ ] Build admin approval interface
- [ ] Implement calendar availability view
- [ ] Add email notifications
- [ ] Integrate payment processing (optional)
- [ ] Add rental history tracking
- [ ] Build customer-facing booking dashboard

#### Notes

**Decision**: Focus on product management and catalog display first. Booking system is a major feature that can be built later once the core rental catalog is stable and being used.

## Migration Strategy

### Deprecating Shopify

#### Files to Keep (Reference Only)

- `/lib/shopify/` - Keep entire directory for reference
- `/components/Shop/Products-Card.tsx` - Keep as template for rental cards
- `/app/shop/page.tsx` - Keep for layout reference

#### Files to Mark as Deprecated

Add comment at top of Shopify-related files:

```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated This file uses Shopify integration which is no longer active.
 * Kept for reference only. See /app/rent/* for rental product implementation.
 */
```

#### Files to Mark

- [ ] `/lib/shopify/*.ts`
- [ ] `/app/shop/page.tsx`
- [ ] `/components/Shop/*` (except reusable patterns)

#### Navigation Updates

- [ ] Remove "Shop" link from navigation (or redirect to /rent)
- [ ] Add "Rent" link to navigation
- [ ] Update any internal links pointing to /shop

- **2025-10-26**: Decided to reuse Shopify UI patterns (grid, cards) for faster development
- **2025-10-26**: Deferred booking/reservation system to Phase 10 (future enhancement)

### Deviations from Original Plan

_Document any changes to the original plan here_
