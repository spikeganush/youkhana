## Project Goal

Add an invitation-only admin space to the Youkhana e-commerce website where the master admin (yyoukhanaa@gmail.com) can invite and manage users with role-based access control.

**Status**: üü° In Progress
**Started**: 2025-10-25
**Target Completion**: TBD

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Solution: NextAuth v5 (Auth.js)
**Reason**: Free, self-hosted, full control over user data

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ‚ùå Clerk: Paid after 10k MAU ($25/month base)
- ‚ùå Lucia Auth: Deprecated in March 2025
- ‚ùå Better Auth: Too new, less documentation
- ‚úÖ NextAuth v5: Free, mature, great Next.js 16 support

### Admin Dashboard UI: Shadcn UI + TanStack Table
**Reason**: Free, modern, lightweight (57KB), full control

**Alternatives Considered**:
- ‚ùå Refine: More opinionated, steeper learning curve
- ‚ùå NextAdmin: Requires PostgreSQL (we use Redis)
- ‚ùå React-Admin: Heavy bundle (315KB), poor Next.js SSR
- ‚úÖ Shadcn UI: Perfect fit for our stack

### User Storage: Upstash Redis
**Reason**: Already in use, fast, serverless-friendly

**Data Structure**:
- Users stored as: `user:{email}` hash
- Invitations: `invitation:{token}` hash
- Indexes: `users:all`, `invitations:pending` sets

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Version | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Authentication | NextAuth v5 | beta | Auth system |
| Session Adapter | @auth/upstash-redis-adapter | latest | Store sessions in Redis |
| UI Components | Shadcn UI | latest | Admin dashboard UI |
| Data Tables | TanStack Table | latest | User management tables |
| Email Provider | Resend | 1.0.0 | Send invitation emails |
| Database | Upstash Redis | 1.34.3 | User & session storage |

- Generated secure AUTH_SECRET using openssl
- Created comprehensive auth helper functions: `getSession()`, `requireAuth()`, `requireAdmin()`, `requireMasterAdmin()`, etc.
- Configured Resend email provider for magic link authentication
- Set up database session strategy with 30-day expiration
- Implemented middleware to protect `/admin` routes with role checking
- Extended NextAuth types to include custom role field (MASTER_ADMIN | ADMIN | MEMBER)

**Security Features Implemented**:
- Only users that exist in Redis can sign in (invitation-only)

// Invitation object stored at key: invitation:{token}
interface Invitation {
  email: string;
  role: 'ADMIN' | 'MEMBER';
  token: string; // Unique random token (64 hex chars)
  expiresAt: string; // ISO timestamp (7 days from creation)
  createdBy: string; // Email of admin who created it
  createdAt: string; // ISO timestamp
  status: 'pending' | 'used' | 'expired';
  usedAt?: string; // ISO timestamp when used
}

// Redis Keys:
// - invitation:{token} - Hash storing invitation data
// - invitations:pending - Set of pending invitation tokens
// - invitation:email:{email} - String mapping email to token (for duplicate prevention)
```

#### Notes
**Implementation Details**:
- Successfully created comprehensive invitation system with full lifecycle management
- Implemented secure token generation using crypto.randomBytes (32 bytes = 64 hex chars)
- Built invitation management page with real-time stats and TanStack Table
- Created email sending functionality using Resend with inline HTML template
- Implemented signup flow with token validation and automatic expiration checking
- Added duplicate invitation prevention (can't invite same email twice)
- Created verify-email page to guide users after account creation
- All server actions include proper authentication and permission checks

**Security Features Implemented**:
- Secure random token generation (64 character hex strings)
- Automatic expiration checking (7 days configurable via env)
- Prevention of duplicate invitations
- Cannot invite MASTER_ADMIN through invitation system
- Validation that user doesn't already exist before creating invitation
- Token validation prevents reuse of already-used invitations
- Expired invitations automatically marked and removed from pending set
- All actions verify user permissions via RBAC system

**UI/UX Features**:
- Clean invitation form with email and role selection
- Invitation table with sortable columns and search
- Real-time expiration countdown display (shows "2d 5h remaining")
- Resend and cancel actions with loading states
- Confirmation dialog for canceling invitations
- Stats cards showing pending, admin, and member invitation counts
- Professional email template with clear call-to-action
- Signup page with clear instructions and what-happens-next guide
- Verify-email page with helpful next steps

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used inline HTML email template instead of React Email for simplicity (can upgrade later)
- Implemented email index for fast duplicate checking
- Used crypto module for secure token generation
- Automatic cleanup of expired invitations when fetching pending list
- Resend creates new invitation with new token and expiry (deletes old one)
- Auto sign-in after signup sends magic link email
- Sidebar already had Invitations link from Phase 2

**Integration Points**:
- Integrates with existing RBAC permissions system
- Uses existing Resend email provider from auth setup
- Leverages existing Redis instance and patterns
- Follows same patterns as user management from Phase 3
- Works with existing sign-in page and auth flow

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ All files compile successfully with no TypeScript errors

  - [x] Queryable by category, user, action, and resource

#### Files Created
- ‚úÖ `/lib/validations.ts` - Comprehensive Zod validation schemas
- ‚úÖ `/lib/rate-limit.ts` - Rate limiting system using Redis
- ‚úÖ `/lib/audit-log.ts` - Audit logging system with Redis storage

#### Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `/app/admin/invitations/actions.ts` - Added Zod validation, rate limiting, and audit logging
- ‚úÖ `/app/admin/users/actions.ts` - Added Zod validation and audit logging

#### Notes
**Implementation Details**:
- Successfully created comprehensive input validation system using Zod
- All inputs are validated, sanitized (lowercase, trim), and type-checked
- Implemented Redis-based rate limiting:
  - Invitation creation: 10 per hour per user
  - User deletion: 20 per hour per user (configured but not yet applied)
  - Graceful fallback on Redis errors (allows action to prevent legitimate users from being blocked)
- Created comprehensive audit logging system:
  - All admin actions logged with detailed metadata
  - Logs stored in Redis with 90-day TTL
  - Multiple query methods: by category, user, action type, resource
  - Logs include: timestamp, performer, role, action, resource, result, error messages
  - Automatic indexing in sorted sets for efficient querying

**Security Features Added**:
1. **Input Validation with Zod**:
   - Email validation with RFC compliance
   - Automatic lowercase and trimming
   - Role validation against enum
   - Token format validation (64-char hex)
   - Name length restrictions (1-100 chars)

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Redis-based sliding window rate limiting
   - Configurable limits per action type
   - User-specific rate limits
   - Clear error messages with reset time
   - Graceful degradation on Redis failures

3. **Audit Logging**:
   - Complete audit trail of all admin actions
   - Success and failure logging
   - Detailed metadata capture
   - Efficient Redis storage with TTL
   - Multiple indexing strategies for fast queries

**Security Already in Place (from previous phases)**:
- Authentication verification in all server actions
- Role-based permission checking
- Master admin protection (cannot be deleted or modified)
- User cannot delete themselves
- CSRF protection (NextAuth built-in)
- Session-based authentication with Redis
- Duplicate invitation prevention
- Email verification before account creation
- Invitation expiration (7 days)

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used Zod for validation instead of manual checks for better type safety and consistency
- Implemented rate limiting at the application level (not nginx/middleware) for easier configuration
- Stored audit logs in Redis instead of separate database for simplicity and auto-expiration
- Used sorted sets for efficient time-based queries on audit logs
- Made rate limiting gracefully degrade (allow on error) to prevent false negatives
- All validation errors return user-friendly messages

**Error Handling Improvements**:
- All server actions return structured ActionResult type
- Consistent error message format
- Error logging with console.error for debugging
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- Audit logging captures both successes and failures
- User-friendly messages instead of technical errors

**Build Status**: ‚úÖ All files compile successfully with no TypeScript errors
